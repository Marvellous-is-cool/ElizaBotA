# MongoDB Connection Fix

The following changes have been made to fix the MongoDB connection issue in the Gunicorn environment:

## 1. Updated `safe_main.py`

- Added explicit MongoDB initialization before starting the bot
- Added proper error handling for database connection failures
- Added environment variable validation for MongoDB credentials
- Added cleanup to ensure database connections are closed on errors

## 2. Enhanced `db/mongo_client.py`

- Added better error reporting during connection attempts
- Added masking of credentials in logs for security
- Added more detailed troubleshooting information
- Increased the connection timeout for more reliability

## 3. Updated `wsgi.py` and `gunicorn_config.py`

- Added MongoDB connection status logging
- Added better error handling specific to MongoDB issues
- Added troubleshooting guidance for MongoDB connection problems

## 4. Enhanced `start.sh`

- Added MongoDB credential validation before starting Gunicorn
- Added MongoDB connection test during startup
- Added better feedback about MongoDB connection status

## 5. New Testing Tools

- Created `test_mongodb_connection.py` for dedicated MongoDB connection testing
- Created `MONGODB_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` with detailed troubleshooting guidance

## Testing the Fix

To test if MongoDB is connecting properly:

1. First, try the dedicated test script:
   ```bash
   python test_mongodb_connection.py
   ```

2. If the test is successful, try running with the improved start script:
   ```bash
   ./start.sh
   ```

3. Check the logs for MongoDB connection status:
   - "Successfully connected to MongoDB" indicates success
   - Error messages will include detailed troubleshooting guidance

## Environment Variables

Make sure the following environment variables are set in your Render dashboard:

- `MONGODB_URI`: Your MongoDB connection string
- `MONGODB_DB_NAME`: Your database name (optional, will use default if not set)
- `ROOM_ID`: Your Highrise room ID
- `BOT_TOKEN`: Your Highrise bot token

## Next Steps

If you continue to have issues with MongoDB connection on Render:

1. Check if the MongoDB Atlas IP access list includes Render's IP addresses
2. Verify that your MongoDB Atlas cluster is in the "Available" state
3. Try using the MongoDB connection string format that includes all options:
   ```
   mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/dbname?retryWrites=true&w=majority&authSource=admin
   ```

The code is now much more resilient to MongoDB connection issues and provides better feedback when problems occur.
